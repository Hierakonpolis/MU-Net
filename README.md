# MU-Net
**[Multi-task U-Net for the simultaneous segmentation and skull-stripping of mouse brain MRI](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.964015v1)**
![sample image](sample.png)
This convolutional neural network is designed to perform skull-stripping and region segmentation on mouse brain MRI. A jupyter notebook going over the deails of this project and the training procedure is available [here](https://github.com/Hierakonpolis/NN4Kubiac). To train this on your data we recommend using the scripts found in our more recent release [MU-Net-R](https://github.com/Hierakonpolis/MU-Net-R)

Files included:

MUNet.py: network definitions

runMU-Net.py : script to run segmentation on nifti MRI volumes

helperfile: Auxiliary functions for runMU-Net.py

weights, AuxW: trained network parameters for each dataset fold

weights_N3, AuxW_N3: network parameters when trained on N3-corrected MRI volumes

Developed in PyTorch 1.0.1, the included script also requires nibabel, skimage and tqdm. 

This network is trained on coronal T2 mouse brain MRI delineated with a bounding box, and so for the network to function correctly MRI volumes need to be cropped to a bounding box around the brain. To automate this task we include a lightweight auxiliary network. You can exclude this step by using the "--boundingbox False" option.
## Installation:
It is recommended to create a virtual environment. For this guide we will assume you are using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) data science platform. You can download Anaconda for your system [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

0. Creating a new environment: 

    `conda create --name MyEnv`
    
1. Activate it: 

    `conda activate MyEnv`

2. Install PyTorch. Visit https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ and select your OS, package manager and CUDA version. Input the suggested line in your conda environment. It should look like this: 

    `conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch`

3. Install other required packages: 

    `conda install tqdm numpy`

4. These packages are available from a different channel: 

    `conda install -c conda-forge scikit-image nibabel scipy`

5. Clone this repository: 

    `git clone https://github.com/Hierakonpolis/MU-Net`

## Usage:
python3 runMU-Net.py [options] [list of volumes]

[list of volumes] is a list of paths to nifti volumes separated by spaces

If a folder path is specified, all .nii and .ni.gz files will be added recursvely

Options:

--overwrite [True/False]: Overwrite outputs if file already exists (default: False)
    
--N3 [True/False]: Load model weights for N3 corrected volumes (default False)
    
--multinet [True/False]: use networks trained on all folds and apply majority voting. (default True)

--probmap [True/False]: output unthresholded probability maps rather than the segmented volumes (default False)

--boundingbox [True/False]: automatically estimate bounding box using auxiliary network (default True)

--useGPU [True/False]: run on GPU, requires a CUDA enabled GPU and PyTorch installed with GPU support (default True)

--namemask: only include files containing this string (case sensitive). Example: --namemask MySeq.nii

--nameignore: exclude all files containing this string (case sensitive). Example: --nameignore NotThisSeq.nii

Mask volumes are generated in the same folder as the segmented files.

Example: 

python3 runMU-Net.py --overwrite True my/favourite/mouse.nii my/other/one.nii
